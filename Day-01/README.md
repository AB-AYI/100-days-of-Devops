ðŸ“˜ Day 01 â€“ Creating a User with Non-Interactive Shell
ðŸ”¹ Task

On App Server 2, the security team requested creating a user named kirsty with a non-interactive shell. This is to ensure the user account exists for process ownership or automation purposes but cannot log in interactively to the server.

ðŸ”¹ Solution
# Connect to App Server 2 from the jumpserver
ssh steve@stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com 
Enter password: Am3ric@

# Create user with a non-interactive shell
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin kirsty


ðŸ”¹ Explanation

useradd â†’ Command used to create a new user.

-s /sbin/nologin â†’ Assigns a non-interactive shell. This prevents the user from accessing a terminal session.

kirsty â†’ The username to be created.

Why?

Some users are required for service accounts, automation, or process ownership, but they should not log in like normal users.

Assigning /sbin/nologin ensures security: if someone tries to log in as kirsty, the system immediately denies access without starting a shell.

This is a best practice in system hardening, especially in DevOps environments where least-privilege access is critical.

ðŸ”¹ Verification

To confirm user creation and shell assignment:

grep kirsty /etc/passwd


Expected output:

kirsty:x:1002:1002::/home/kirsty:/sbin/nologin


This shows:

Username: kirsty

Default home directory /home/kirsty

Shell is /sbin/nologin â†’ confirming no interactive login.

ðŸ”¹ Reflection

Today I learned how to create restricted system users in Linux. Such accounts are commonly used in DevOps for automation, scheduled jobs, or to run applications securely. By giving them a non-interactive shell, we reduce the attack surface and maintain system integrity.
